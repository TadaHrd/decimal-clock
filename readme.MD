# Decimal Clock

This is a centesimal (base 100) alternate to the sexagesimal (base 60) time system.

In the sexagesimal time system are:
- 60 seconds in a minute
- 60 minutes in an hour
- 24 hours in a day

In the centesimal time system are:
- 100 seconds in a minute
- 100 minutes in an hour
- 8 hours in a day

The reason there are 8 hours in a day instead of 10 is so thatseconds in the centesimal system are very similar in length.

Centesimal seconds take 25/27 of the time a regular second takes.
That means that centesimal seconds are 1.08x faster than regular seconds.
